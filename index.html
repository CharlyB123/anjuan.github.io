<p>Hello, my name is Anjuan, and I like to build things and help others understand how to build things. I'm a consultant, technologist, speaker, and author.</p>
	
<p>Most of the people who visit my site work in the technology field or are involved in public speaking either as speakers or event organizers. I have content available for both groups.</p>

<p>If you work in the technology field, you'll probably want to read my <a href="http://anjuansimmons.com/blog/">blog</a> posts in the Software Development, Career, or Business <a href="http://anjuansimmons.com/categories/">categories</a>. These posts are written from the perspective of my decades-long career in the technology industry.</p>
	
<p>If you're involved in public speaking as a speaker, you can read about what I've learned as a public speaker in the Speaking <a href="http://anjuansimmons.com/categories/">category</a>. Event organizers looking for speakers can take a look at my <a href="http://anjuansimmons.com/talks/">talks</a> or learn more about how to <a href="http://anjuansimmons.com/booking/">book me</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not a technologist or involved in speaking, then feel free to get to know more <a href="http://anjuansimmons.com/about/">about me</a>, check out my <a href="http://anjuansimmons.com/resume/">résumé</a>, or <a href="http://anjuansimmons.com/contact/">contact me</a>. I would love to get to know you better!</p>
