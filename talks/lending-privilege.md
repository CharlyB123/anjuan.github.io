## Abstract

Diversity and inclusion have become hot topics in technology, but you may not know how you can make a difference. This talk will help you understand that, no matter your background, you have privilege and can lend it to underrepresented groups in tech.

## Description

Privilege is access to societal and economic benefits based on characteristics you possess. The most well understood forms of privilege are the ones most people don’t choose for themselves like racial, gender, and physical privilege, but there are also selected privileges like religion, career, and education.

This session will teach attendees how to lend their privilege. They will learn the various types of privilege lending including credibility lending (where you provide visibility to someone without privilege), access lending (where you provide access to someone without privilege), and expertise lending (where you provide a voice to someone without privilege). These different types of privilege lending will be illustrated through well known examples and an explanation of how they can be applied to software development teams.

## Pitch

While technology companies are trying to improve their diversity, I believe that change will only occur when individuals take action to make technology a more inclusive industry. I think that the concept of lending privilege can be a powerful tool that technology practitioners can use to expand the diversity of the industry.

## Slides

| # | Slide  | Speaker Notes  |
|:-:|:-------|:-------------|
| <b>1</b> | <img src="/images/Lending-Privilege-Images.001.jpeg" alt="Slide 1 - Introduction" style="width:9000px; height:auto;"> | I’ve worked in software development for 20 years, and I sometimes think that diversity will fade as a topic in tech. I mean, are we still talking about this? But, something always happens. <br><br>Someone writes about the extreme sexism they experienced at a large and well known tech company. Or, someone else goes the opposite direction and writes a manifesto about why diversity in tech efforts are misguided. No matter where you are on the spectrum between these two points of view, I think the topic of diversity is here to stay. And there are real problems. |
| <b>2</b> | <img src="/images/Lending-Privilege-Images.002.jpeg" alt="Slide 2 - Balance" style="width:9000px; height:auto;"> | Technology companies are overwhelmingly homogenous and lack the balance you would expect based on the overall population. <br><br> Also, benefits like pay and promotions are unequally distributed and, in fact, trend towards the dominant demographic.|
| <b>3</b> | <img src="/images/Lending-Privilege-Images.003.jpeg" alt="Slide 3 - Television" style="width:9000px; height:auto;"> | But, this isn’t a new problem. Several years ago an actor on a television show faced a dilemma. One of the big stars of the show but it wasn’t doing all that well in the ratings.  But, that wasn’t the problem.  This actor learned that an actress who also starred on the show wasn’t being paid as much as the other male actors.  Since this actor was beloved by fans of the show, had a lot of influence.  This actor went to the studio executives and used his influence to demand equal pay for this actress. And it worked. The actress received pay equal to her male counterparts. |
| <b>4</b> | <img src="/images/Lending-Privilege-Images.004.jpeg" alt="Slide 4 - Star Trek" style="width:9000px; height:auto;"> | The television show was “Star Trek”, the actor was Leonard Nimoy (who played Spock), and the actress was Nichelle Nichols (who played Uhura). That's right, Leonard Nimoy was down with equal pay for equal work way before it was cool. Nimoy lent Nichols his privilege: his gender privilege as a male actor and his influence privilege with the fans. By lending her privilege, he furthered her position as an actress by giving her access to better pay. Now, you may be wondering what does this have to do with Ruby?. Software as an industry suffers from a lack of diversity. Whether it's open source or closed source, developing or deploying code, the people working in software development don't represent the general population nor are rewards like pay, promotions, and positions of leadership equally distributed. We face the reality that a woman working *today* on a Ruby project may have *less* access to equal pay than an actress who worked on a failed TV show in the 1960s. And the danger of a non-inclusive technology industry are higher than ever as we build software that literally goes where we’ve never gone before. AI is amazing, but what if it’s weaponized to influence elections or attack power grids? I also think that the recent high profile examples of powerful men in tech harassing women is a diversity and inclusion problem. If we want to change the world, we first have to change ourselves. We need as many people as possible to help us create the future we want, but aspects of our industry keep people out. <br><br>However, I believe that Leonard Nimoy provided a model for how we can address this problem. Notice that Nimoy didn't wait for Paramount to create a Diversity Program nor did he wait for a better salary policy to be handed down from his superiors. Nimoy acted based on his beliefs of what was right. Nimoy lent Nichols, a fellow artist, the privilege that he had as a male actor and helped her participate in the financial benefits of his gender privilege. And I think that there are a lot of Leonard Nimoy's in this audience. And I also think there are other ways to lend privilege to make technology a more diverse and more inclusive industry. |
| <b>5</b> | <img src="/images/Lending-Privilege-Images.005.jpeg" alt="Slide 5 - ASA Research" style="width:9000px; height:auto;"> | Not only did Nimoy foresee the value of equal pay for equal work, but he may have also foresaw what the ASA reported in 2009 about race, gender and the business case for diversity. <br><br>This report found that having racial and gender diversity in a company led to positive business outcomes. |
| <b>6</b> | <img src="/images/Lending-Privilege-Images.006.jpeg" alt="Slide 6 - Peterson Research" style="width:9000px; height:auto;"> | Or, maybe Nimoy foresaw what this study of 22,000 firms found in 2016 which is that women leaders lead to more revenue. <br><br>The link between diversity and business value is clear but we often can’t access this value because we block people without privilege. |
| <b>7</b> | <img src="/images/Lending-Privilege-Images.007.jpeg" alt="Slide 7 - Diversity versus Inclusion" style="width:9000px; height:auto;"> |  I’ve been using the term diversity, but we need to distinguish between diversity and inclusion. <br><br>Let’s say you’re throwing a party. Diversity is sending invitations. You include your college friends, maybe a few folks from high school, a work friend or two; it’s easy. |
| <b>8</b> | <img src="/images/Lending-Privilege-Images.008.jpeg" alt="Slide 8 - Grass Roots Inclusion" style="width:9000px; height:auto;"> | Inclusion goes further than diversity. Inclusion means being extra nice to your guests who came a long way or providing nonalcoholic beverages to those who don’t drink. Inclusion requires empathy. Diversity just needs a stamp. <br><br>Big companies will continue to play the diversity numbers game through their HR and Marketing departments. HR doesn't exist to protect you. It exists to protect the company that funds it.<br><br>We need a grassroots movement. We need to mobilize Leonard Nimoys throughout our industry. We can’t wait for tech companies to do this. |
| <b>9</b> | <img src="/images/Lending-Privilege-Images.009.jpeg" alt="Slide 9 - The Cathedral and the Bazaar" style="width:9000px; height:auto;"> | Since we work in tech, especially those of us who contribute to open source software projects, we understand grassroots movements. One of the first books on open source software was ”The Cathedral and the Bazaar” by Eric S. Raymond. In this book, Raymond explored the miracle of Linux. We really don’t think much about it now, Linux was this crazy project that let everyone contribute to taking this complicated kernal to create a useful operating system.And it worked! Raymond began to use the principles of open source software in his projects and he distilled lessons that he used to write his book. Raymond likened closed source software development to a cathedral where there is centralized command and control, and he compared it to open source software which he described as a loud babbling bazaar where power is distributed among many loud voices. And, spoiler alert, the bazaar model produced better results. <br><br>The lesson that is most well known from “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” is this one: <br><br>“Given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow”. Now, I hope that many of you have heard this phrase, but I want to focus on the more formal version of this statement from the book which reads of follows: <br><br>“Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone”.<br><br>That is a statement of inclusion. Raymond linked the size of the co-developer base to problem solving. And what else is innovation other than the ability to solve a problem? <br><br>If let source software development be this big tent, this babbling, boisterous bazaar of people who are involved in the development of software and dedicated to making it better, then there is no problem we can’t solve. <br><br>And that's the promise of inclusion. But the sad reality is that just like our repositories are protected by by passwords and permissions, often our companies are protected by privilege and there are voices that we keep out of this bazaar that we don’t create a space for them to take part in our projects and in our companies.<br><br>Certain groups have a hard time lending their voices to the babbling bazaar that Raymond described because they lack privilege. <br><br>This is tragic, because, whatever problem you have within your company, within your source code, or within your deployment process, someone out there can fix it. But, they are often... |
| <b>10</b> | <img src="/images/Lending-Privilege-Images.010.jpeg" alt="Slide 10 - 403" style="width:9000px; height:auto;"> |  ...denied entry into our companies. To understand how this works and what we can do to make things better, we have to understand privilege. <br><br>But before we do that, it’s really important that we understand what privilege is not.|
| <b>11</b> | <img src="/images/Lending-Privilege-Images.011.jpeg" alt="Slide 11 - Privilege 1" style="width:9000px; height:auto;"> |  Having privilege doesn’t mean you haven’t worked hard or that everything is easy for you. It’s like riding a bike up a hill. Pedaling hard, sweating, maybe have a cramp in your right leg. But, there are other people also riding up that hill . . .|
| <b>12</b> | <img src="/images/Lending-Privilege-Images.012.jpeg" alt="Slide 12 - Privilege 2" style="width:9000px; height:auto;"> | And they face obstacles that you don’t even see. Obstacles that you don’t have to worry about. And not only does privilege allow you to not worry about these obstacles, it also gives you benefits.|
| <b>13</b> | <img src="/images/Lending-Privilege-Images.013.jpeg" alt="Slide 13 - Privilege of Access" style="width:9000px; height:auto;"> | So, now that we know what privilege is not, let’s define privilege. Privilege is simply access to benefits based on traits you possess. Those benefits could be schools, jobs, social circles, leadership roles and wealth. <br><br> But there are other benefits. <br><br>Like the benefit of being pulled over by the police and not thinking if your skin color may lead this to being the last drive you ever take.<br><br> Or, the benefit of being seen at a bar with your partner by a co-worker and not worrying if your fellow sysadmins will think less of you. <br><br> Or, the benefit of not worrying if your hearing aid malfunctions during work, and someone uses it as a risk to the infrastructure team. <br><br> Or, the benefit of not having to change your clothes multiple times in the morning because someone may question your capabilities as a technologist simply because you happen to be dressed a certain way. <br><br>This last example shows the reality that women are hired to fill two roles in tech companies. The role they were hired to do and the role of fighting the stereotypes that people have of them. And this second role is exhausting. Why don’t we just let women do their jobs without the burden of sexism and misogyny. I think lending privilege can help do this. There are two major categories of privilege. |
| <b>14</b> | <img src="/images/Lending-Privilege-Images.014.jpeg" alt="Slide 14 - Birth Privileges" style="width:9000px; height:auto;"> | There are birth privileges which come from the two people who made you. These include your race, gender, base level of physical ability and basically everything else we usually use to discriminate against people. |
| <b>15</b> | <img src="/images/Lending-Privilege-Images.015.jpeg" alt="Slide 15 - Selected Privileges" style="width:9000px; height:auto;"> | Then there are selected privileges which include religion, education, your career and everything else that can be easily maxed out by having access to a trust fund. |

*I really enjoyed the next trio of talks. First up was Anjuan Simmons about Lending Privilege. What he meant by this was to work not only toward building up diversity in your organization, but also factoring in inclusion. His talk stressed the importance of what people in the majority populations in tech can do to help minorities, including lending them your credibility, helping them with access to the tooling and levels of trust they have, encouraging them in their roles and sharing of expertise. On a personal note, I’ll emphasize that it’s easier to be a mentor to people who you share a background, race and gender with, which results in minorities struggling to find mentors. We must do better than what is easy and work to mentor people who are different than we are.* - Elizabeth Krumbach Joseph
