## Abstract

Diversity and inclusion have become hot topics in technology, but you may not know how you can make a difference. This talk will help you understand that, no matter your background, you have privilege and can lend it to marginalized groups in tech.

## Description

Privilege is access to societal and economic benefits based on a characteristic you possess. The most well understood forms of privilege are the ones most people don’t choose for themselves like racial, gender, and physical privilege, but there are also selected privileges like religion, sexuality, and education.

This session will teach you how to lend your privilege. You’ll learn the various types of privilege lending including credibility lending (where you attach your name to a project being undertaken by someone without privilege) and access lending (where you provide access to a location or event for someone without privilege). These different types of privilege lending will be illustrated through well known examples and an explanation of how they can be applied to software development.

## Pitch

While technology companies are trying to improve their diversity, I believe that change will only occur when individuals take action to make technology a more inclusive industry. I think that the concept of lending privilege can be a powerful tool that technology practitioners can use to expand the diversity of the industry.

| <b>1</b> | <img src="/images/Lending-Privilege-Images.001.jpeg" alt="Slide 1 - Introduction" style="width:9000px; height:auto;"> | I’ve worked in software development for 20 years, and I sometimes think that diversity will fade as a topic in tech.

| <b>2</b> | <img src="/images/Lending-Privilege-Images.002.jpeg" alt="Slide 2 - Balance" style="width:9000px; height:auto;"> | Technology companies are overwhelmingly homogenous and lack the balance you would expect based on the overall population. <br><br> Also, benefits like pay and promotions are unequally distributed and, in fact, trend towards the dominant demographic.<br><br>|
| <b>3</b> | <img src="/images/Lending-Privilege-Images.003.jpeg" alt="Slide 3 - Television" style="width:9000px; height:auto;"> | But, this isn’t a new problem. Several years ago an actor on a television show faced a dilemma. One of the big stars of the show but it wasn’t doing all that well in the ratings.  But, that wasn’t the problem.  This actor learned that an actress who also starred on the show wasn’t being paid as much as the other male actors.  Since this actor was beloved by fans of the show, had a lot of influence.  This actor went to the studio executives and used his influence to demand equal pay for this actress. And it worked. The actress received pay equal to her male counterparts. <br><br>|
| <b>4</b> | <img src="/images/Lending-Privilege-Images.004.jpeg" alt="Slide 4 - Star Trek" style="width:9000px; height:auto;"> | The television show was “Star Trek”, the actor was Leonard Nimoy (who played Spock), and the actress was Nichelle Nichols (who played Uhura). That's right, Leonard Nimoy was down with equal pay for equal work way before it was cool. Nimoy lent Nichols his privilege: his gender privilege as a male actor and his influence privilege with the fans. By lending her privilege, he furthered her position as an actress by giving her access to better pay. Now, you may be wondering what does this have to do with Ruby?. Software as an industry suffers from a lack of diversity. Whether it's open source or closed source, developing or deploying code, the people working in software development don't represent the general population nor are rewards like pay, promotions, and positions of leadership equally distributed. We face the reality that a woman working *today* on a Ruby project may have *less* access to equal pay than an actress who worked on a failed TV show in the 1960s. And the danger of a non-inclusive technology industry are higher than ever as we build software that literally goes where we’ve never gone before. AI is amazing, but what if it’s weaponized to influence elections or attack power grids? I also think that the recent high profile examples of powerful men in tech harassing women is a diversity and inclusion problem. If we want to change the world, we first have to change ourselves. We need as many people as possible to help us create the future we want, but aspects of our industry keep people out. <br><br>However, I believe that Leonard Nimoy provided a model for how we can address this problem. Notice that Nimoy didn't wait for Paramount to create a Diversity Program nor did he wait for a better salary policy to be handed down from his superiors. Nimoy acted based on his beliefs of what was right. Nimoy lent Nichols, a fellow artist, the privilege that he had as a male actor and helped her participate in the financial benefits of his gender privilege. And I think that there are a lot of Leonard Nimoy's in this audience. And I also think there are other ways to lend privilege to make technology a more diverse and more inclusive industry. <br><br>|

*I really enjoyed the next trio of talks. First up was Anjuan Simmons about Lending Privilege. What he meant by this was to work not only toward building up diversity in your organization, but also factoring in inclusion. His talk stressed the importance of what people in the majority populations in tech can do to help minorities, including lending them your credibility, helping them with access to the tooling and levels of trust they have, encouraging them in their roles and sharing of expertise. On a personal note, I’ll emphasize that it’s easier to be a mentor to people who you share a background, race and gender with, which results in minorities struggling to find mentors. We must do better than what is easy and work to mentor people who are different than we are.* - Elizabeth Krumbach Joseph
