## Abstract

Agile software development methods continue to be popular ways to build software. Agile principles have expanded to other industries such as car manufacturing and construction. However, while there are many books and courses that teach Agile, the principles have to be experienced to truly understand them. This workshop will provide you with interactive lessons that will ease your transition to your first Agile project and also reinforce core concepts for experienced Agile practitioners.
