## Abstract

Whether you’re a Tech Lead, Engineering Manager, or Project Manager for an engineering team, you probably weren’t handed an instruction manual when you were given your first team to lead. This talk will show you how to apply the principles in the Manifesto Agile Manifesto to become a better leader.

## Description

When I was given my first technical team to lead many years ago, I didn’t know what to do. I copied the style of technical leads I worked with and what I could learn by reading USENET newsgroups about leadership (yes, it was that long ago). The results were mixed, and I felt that I was constantly making it up as I went along. However, after I began leading projects that used Agile software development, I eventually realized that the principles behind Agile provided powerful guidelines for leading my teams! Using these principles made me a more effective leader, increased team morale, and improved my ability to deliver software to customers.

This session will help attendees understand the principles behind the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and how to practically apply them directly to their daily leadership decisions.
