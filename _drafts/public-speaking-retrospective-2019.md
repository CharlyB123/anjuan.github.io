I published an end-of-the-year retrospective on my public speaking career in [2016](http://anjuansimmons.com/blog/public-speaking-retrospective-2016/), and I followed that with one for [2017](https://anjuansimmons.com/blog/public-speaking-retrospective-2017/). I didn't publish one in 2018 because the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 were incredibly busy for me. However, with a relatively recent sense of calm, here is my public speaking retrospective for 2019.
