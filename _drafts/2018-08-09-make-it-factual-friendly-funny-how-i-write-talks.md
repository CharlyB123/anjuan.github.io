One of the biggest challenges that face public speakers is creating an engaging talk that will captivate audiences and help them understand your key points. Early in my speaking career, I struggled to find a process that would help me make better use of the hours of work required to build a talk. I eventually found a model in my industry: software engineering.

"Make it work, make it right, make it fast" (often attributed to [Kent Beck](http://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast)) is a maxim for building software. It basically says that software development should focus on a working implementation of each feature (not worrying about elegance), then improving the code (refactor, eliminate code smells, etc.), and then making the code performant. This maxim is meant to reduce the risk of delay caused by spending too much up front time thinking through all the ways the feature can be implemented.

While I think most people think of this maxim too serially, it's a good guideline for thinking about code. I have a similar maxim for building conference talks: "Make it factual, make it friendly, make it funny".

# Make It Factual

"Make it right" means that the talk has to be factually true. I have to make sure that I'm creating a talk with sufficient supporting material.


Theme

Audience profile

Research

# Make it Friendly

"Make it friendly" means that the talk should should have a friendly design. It should use text sparingly, make extensive use of images, and help guide them through the story I'm telling on stage.

Passion

Image driven

Know their pain points

Current events

My life and relatable experiences

Mistakes

Lessons learned

Deep thought behind each slide

# Make it Funny

"Make it funny" means that there should be enough humor sprinkled through the talk to keep the audience engaged. I've found that laughter is a great way to facilitate learning.

Hardest part

Find humor in the facts or a situation from my life

Agile Manifesto Joke

# Summary

I try to not be too serial when doing this myself. When I'm researching a talk, if I think of a funny line or find a great image, I put it in.

However, this approach does help me avoid spinning my wheels early in the talk's evolution. Instead of looking for stock images or trying to insert jokes, I can focus on facts. Once the factual backbone of the talk is in place, I can go back and layer on imagery, fonts, humor, etc.

I've found this immensely helpful in shortening the time between the idea of my talk and a viable version of it that's ready to share with audiences.
