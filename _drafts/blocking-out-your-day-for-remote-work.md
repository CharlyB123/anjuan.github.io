# Remote Work

The spread of novel coronavirus has forced many people to find themselves thrust into working from home. There have been many articles written about how to make the leap to remote work, but I find that a lot of this guidance isn't very structured. Since we all understand the concept of time, I think that understanding remote work as the process of managing blocks of time can be a very useful way to make the transition.


## Prep

* High Speed Internet
* Create a workspace in a separate room with a closable door
* Equipment

Put these blocks in your calendar. It's your choice how to sequence them based on your meeting schedule and other obligations. Aim to give your "Best 40" each week in the way that works for you.

## Opening Block

* Dress
* Stress the importance of ritual. It's important to have something that symbolizes it's time to start work. This can be opening your laptop or saying something like, "It's time to start".

## Meeting Block

* Agendas (in a shared doc)
* Punctuality still matters
* Your appearance still matters
* Look into the camera (as much as possible)
* Facilitator
* Scribe (if possible)
* Post recording afterwards

## Work Block

* Deep Work

## Break Block

* Spread between Meeting Bocks and Work Blocks
* Ideally, leave your workspace. 
* Leave all work notifications (no pings from email, Slack, etc.)
* Whatever you do, don't think about or talk about work
* Do something delightful - have your favorite beverage, go for a walk, etc. By having delighters in your day, it gives you something to look forward to.

## Closing Bock

* Similar to the Opening Block, it's important to have something that symbolizes it's time to finish work. This could be closing your laptop or saying something like, "My work here is finished".

## Arranging the Blocks

Now that you understand the blocks, you can arrange them on your calendar.
