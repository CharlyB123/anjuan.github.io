excerpt: "This is a test draft post."
---

I'm testing the draft capability of Jekyll. To preview this draft on my site, a I need to run `jekyll serve` or `jekyll build` with the `--drafts` switch. Each draft will be assigned the value of tehe last time it was modified for its date. So, currently edited drafts will be seen as the latest posts.
