I've worked remotely on and off for several years, and I've been lucky to work for a fully remote company over he past nine months. It's glorious, and I don't think I can ever be convinced to work in a corporate office ever again.

I'm in Zoom meetings for work several hours each day, and I also do a fair amount of speaking at virtual conferences. That means I appear on other people's screens quite often, and I regularly get asked about my remote office setup. The feedback I've generally received is that my audio and video are notable for their clarity and crispness. This high quality is due to the investments I've made in my home office, and I'm going to share what I think makes my office so great.

## My Office Layout

My wife and I purchased our home in July 2014, and it came with a nice office on the first floor. One thing to be noted is that the actual build of our house is a mirror image of the floor plan above. So, West is on the right side of the picture and East is on the left side.

The builder's floor plan called for the West Wall to just be a regular wall with no windows. However, my wife thought that would result in a room that was too dark so she had the bright idea of adding three windows. I can tell you that she was absolutely right, and I'm so glad we went with her idea.


## Outside the Office

The first thing to understand about my home office is that it's a totally separate room from the rest of the house. This is key because that means I have a door that I can close. That means I can not only have a barrier to keep out noise from the rest of the house, I can also signify to my family that I'm working (i.e., by closing the door).

## The Door from Inside the Office

I purchased a rod and curtains to provide another layer of sound proofing. The doors are more than ten feet high so I had to order really tall curtains.

## The Eastern Wall

This is the area in my office where I spend the most time.
