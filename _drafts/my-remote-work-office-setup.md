I've worked remotely on and off for several years, and I've been lucky to work for a fully remote company over he past nine months. It's glorious, and I don't think I can ever be convinced to work in a corporate office ever again.

I'm in Zoom meetings for work several hours each day, and I also do a fair amount of speaking at virtual conferences. That means I appear on other people's screens quite often, and I regularly get asked about my remote office setup. The feedback I've generally received is that my audio and video are notable for their clarity and crispness. This high quality is due to the investments I've made in my home office, and I'm going to share what I think makes my office so great.

I should add that I've worked for a few companies that provided a stipend for kitting out my remote office. So, I'm fully aware of how much financial privilege that's provided to me. However, I hope this article gives everyone at least an idea of the types of gear that can upgrade your remote experience and budgets can be adjusted accordingly.

## My Office Layout

My wife and I purchased our home in 2014, and it came with a nice office on the first floor. Two things to note about the floor plan above is that my house faces north and the actual build of our house is a mirror image. So, the north side of my house is at the bottom of the image, and you take a right turn from the main entrance to enter my office.

The builder's floor plan called for the West Wall of the study to just be a regular wall with no windows. However, my wife thought that would result in a room that was too dark so she had the bright idea of adding three windows. I can tell you that she was absolutely right, and I'm so glad we went with her idea.

## Outside the Office

The first thing to understand about my home office is that it's a totally separate room from the rest of the house. This is key because that means I have a door that I can close. That means I can not only have a barrier to keep out noise from the rest of the house, I can also signify to my family that I'm working (i.e., by closing the door).

One key part of my remote office setup that you won't see in it is the fiber service from AT&T that provides internet connectivity to my entire home. Since my home has several Nest security cameras that constantly use data and we use several services that require internet access, I made the decision a long time ago to purchase a fast connection.

## The Door from Inside the Office

In addition to having a door that could be closed, I wanted to sound proof my office as much as possible. My office is near the front door and not too far from the dining room and living room. So, at any given moment during the work day, one or more members of my family could be just outside the office or watching TV in the living room. 

I purchased a rod and curtains to provide another layer of sound proofing. The doors are more than ten feet high so I had to order really tall curtains. I also installed seals on the bottom of the door to help keep out sound from the rest of the house.

## East Wall

This is the area in my office where I spend the most time. It's here where I take my calls and also do my work.

### Desk Area

* Standing Desk Compromise (link to cheap Walmart tables)
* Anti-fatigue mat (link to Amazon product)
* Chair (link to Amazon product)
* Map on wall (link to Amazon product)
* Circular Desk
* Trash can
* Wife's Wedding Dress picture

My desk area has a lot of the things that make it easier to get through my work day. I spend the vast majority of my work day standing (hence the anti-fatigue mat), but I wanted the option to sit for the brief times when sitting in a chair made a task easier. I initially looked for those fancy standing desks that could raise or lower at the touch of a button. However, I had a budget to use to build out my home office, and that would have taken a lot of space in the budget that could be used for other things. So, I decided to go with a far more economical approach. I purchased two coffee tables from Walmart that I put on top of my existing desk, and I set up my primary laptop and monitors on top of those tables. That's the set of equipment I use when standing. I can also sit down in the chair and use my secondary laptop and monitor when sitting.

The map on the wall is a backdrop for framing myself in Zoom calls, and the picture of my wife in her wedding dress is just a lovely reminder of how happy I was when we got married. The boomerang on top of the picture is a gift from a co-worker who went to Australia several years ago.

The circular desk beneath my wife's picture is a place to put random items that I don't want to put on the upper or lower desks.

### Upper Desk

* O-Ring Light
* Dell Monitor
* Logitech Brio Webcam
* MacBook Pro Stand
* Wireless Charging Pad (normally for my phone)
* The MacBook Pro is hard wired via Ethernet cable to make maximum use of the fiber internet
* HP Monitor
* Android
* Yeti Mic
* Google Home Mini
* Mailchimp Mascot
* Headphones
* Headphone stand
* Old speakers used as risers for monitors
* iPad
* IPad Stand
* Makeshift Mic riser
* Macally keyboard with numeric keypad
* DIY Risers (set of old speakers)
* Mat on top of desk (to protect the desk)


The upper desk is my command center. I use my MacBook Pro as a hub that drives most of the other equipment on my desk. The two monitors provide enough surface area for me to feel productive. I typically use the left monitor for personal productivity items like my task list, the MacBook screen in the middle is where I put the things I'm currently working on, and the right monitor is usually reserved for communications like email, Slack, Jira, etc.

The keys to the clear sound and crisp picture I present on video calls are the O-ring light, Logitech Brio webcam, Yeti microphone, and Corsair headsets. They provide great lighting as well as strong my audio and video signals. While the MacBook has a built-in webcam, microphone, and speakers, it can't match the experience of using separate dedicated devices.

The iPad is nice for quickly pulling up things like my personal calendar, pulling up my Nest cameras if I hear something outside of the office, or checking personal email.

I also have little "flair" items like the Android and MailChimp mascots. I'm heavily in the Android ecosystem, and I once gave a talk at the MailChimp office in Atlanta so these are just nice personal items.

### Lower Desk


* Scanner
* Monitor
* MacBook
* Printer
* USB extender
* Mat on top of desk (to protect the desk)
* Shredder


I rarely use the lower desk since I stand for most of the day. However, it provides a secondary MacBook as well as an external monitor.


### Behind Desk

* USB-C extender
* Bench
* External Drives

## South Wall (Coffee/Snack Area)

* Coffee Machine
* K-Cup holder (sorry, single use pods are very useful)
* Game of Microphones (speaker badge trophies)
* Diplomas

The South Wall has what I consider to be my break area. I have a coffee machine to properly caffeinate myself throughout the day, healthy snacks, etc. I've thought about getting a water cooler, but that may be going too far.

## West Wall (Library and Kitchen)

* Windows
* Statues
* Power Ups
1. Engagement Photo
2. Wedding Photo
3. Craft Hand drawn portrait
* Book Shelves
* Microwave
* Mini-fridge




* Reminder of ways people have tried to find meaning

1. Thought
2. Christ
3. Glory

The West Wall has my library and kitchen. The top of the wall has those three windows that my wife wisely pushed to get added to the build of our home. I have a statue in each windows that I initially randomly put in each window. However, I know think of them as symbols of three ways that humanity has tried to find meaning in life: thought, religion, and glory.

The top of the bookshelves have what I call "power ups". These are things that I can look at from my desk when I need some positive vibes. They pictures of my wife and I from our engagement photos and on our wedding day. I also have a hand drawn portrait given to be as a gift when I spoke at the Craft Conference in Budapest a few years ago.

The three bookshelves have a hodgepodge of books. They are in desperate need of organizing, but I always have other priorities in my list of things to do. I occasionally turn my webcam around and do video meetings where a bookshelf would make a better backdrop than a map.

## North Wall (Nook)

* Curtain Rod
* Curtain Rod fasteners
* Curtain for privacy and sound proofing
* Chais Lounge
* Floor Lamp
* Laptop Tray
* Dustbuster




## The Essentials

I put a lot of effort into building out my home office for remote work, but I can boil it down to three essentials. First, have a door that can close if at all possible. This gives you a way to really focus on your work without distractions. Second, have dedicated devices for your audio and video. While most laptops come with a built-in webcam, microphone, and speakers, you'll get a much better experience if you purchase good quality stand-alone equipment and plug them into your computer. Finally, invest in good lighting. You don't have to buy a fancy O-ring light. Arranging a few household lamps around your laptop can do wonders.
