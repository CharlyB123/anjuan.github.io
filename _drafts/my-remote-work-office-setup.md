I've worked remotely on and off for several years, and I've been lucky to work for a fully remote company over he past nine months. It's glorious, and I don't think I can ever be convinced to work in a corporate office ever again.

I'm in Zoom meetings for work several hours each day, and I also do a fair amount of speaking at virtual conferences. That means I appear on other people's screens quite often, and I regularly get asked about my remote office setup. The feedback I've generally received is that my audio and video are notable for their clarity and crispness. This high quality is due to the investments I've made in my home office, and I'm going to share what I think makes my office so great.

## My Office Layout

{% include image.html url="/images/mclaran-first-floor.gif" alt="McLaran Layout" caption="My remote office is in the room marked 'Study' on this floorplan." %}

My wife and I purchased our home in 2014, and it came with a nice office on the first floor. Two things to note about the floor plan above is that my house faces north and the actual build of our house is a mirror image. So, the north side of my house is at the bottom of the image, and you take a right turn from the main entrance to enter my office.

The builder's floor plan called for the West Wall of the study to just be a regular wall with no windows. However, my wife thought that would result in a room that was too dark so she had the bright idea of adding three windows. I can tell you that she was absolutely right, and I'm so glad we went with her idea.

## Outside the Office

The first thing to understand about my home office is that it's a totally separate room from the rest of the house. This is key because that means I have a door that I can close. That means I can not only have a barrier to keep out noise from the rest of the house, I can also signify to my family that I'm working (i.e., by closing the door).

One key part of my remote office setup that you won't see in it is the fiber service from AT&T that provides internet connectivity to my entire home. Since my home has several Nest security cameras that constantly use data and we use several services that require internet access, I made the decision a long time ago to purchase a fast connection.

## The Door from Inside the Office

* A - Curtain Rod
* B - Curtain Rod fasteners
* C - Curtain for privacy and sound proofing
* D - Door that closes
* E- Seals on bottom of door

I purchased a rod and curtains to provide another layer of sound proofing. The doors are more than ten feet high so I had to order really tall curtains. I also installed seals on the bottom of the door to help keep out sound from the rest of the house.

## East Wall

This is the area in my office where I spend the most time. It's here where I take my calls and also do my work.

### Desk Area

* Standing Desk Compromise (link to cheap Walmart tables)
* Anti-fatigue mat (link to Amazon product)
* Chair (link to Amazon product)
* Map on wall (link to Amazon product)
* Circular Desk
* Trash can
* Wife's Wedding Dress picture

My desk area has a lot of the things that make it easier to get through my work day. I spend the vast majority of my work day standing (hence the anti-fatigue mat), but I wanted the option to sit for the brief times when sitting in a chair made a task easier. I initially looked for those fancy standing desks that could raise or lower at the touch of a button. However, I had a budget to use to build out my home office, and that would have taken a lot of space in the budget that could be used for other things. So, I decided to go with a far more economical approach. I purchased two coffee tables from Walmart that I put on top of my existing desk, and I set up my primary laptop and monitors on top of those tables. That's the set of equipment I use when standing. I can also sit down in the chair and use my secondary laptop and monitor when sitting.

The map on the wall is a backdrop for framing myself in Zoom calls, and the picture of my wife in her wedding dress is just a lovely reminder of how happy I was when we got married. The boomerang on top of the picture is a gift from a co-worker who went to Australia several years ago.

The circular desk beneath my wife's picture is a place to put random items that I don't want to put on the upper or lower desks.

### Upper Desk

* O-Ring Light
* Dell Monitor
* Logitech Brio Webcam
* MacBook Pro Stand
* Wireless Charging Pad (normally for my phone)
* The MacBook Pro is hard wired via Ethernet cable to make maximum use of the fiber internet
* HP Monitor
* Android
* Yeti Mic
* Google Home Mini
* Mailchimp Mascot
* Headphones
* Headphone stand
* Old speakers used as risers for monitors
* iPad
* IPad Stand
* Makeshift Mic riser
* Macally keyboard with numeric keypad
* DIY Risers (set of old speakers)
* Mat on top of desk (to protect the desk)


The upper desk is my command center. I use my MacBook Pro as a hub that drives most of the other equipment on my desk. The two monitors provide enough surface area for me to feel productive. I typically use the left monitor for personal productivity items like my task list, the MacBook screen in the middle is where I put the things I'm currently working on, and the right monitor is usually reserved for communications like email, Slack, Jira, etc.

The keys to the clear sound and crisp picture I present on video calls are the O-ring light, Logitech Brio webcam, Yeti microphone, and Corsair headsets. They provide great lighting as well as strong my audio and video signals. While the MacBook has a built-in webcam, microphone, and speakers, it can't match the experience of using separate dedicated devices.

The iPad is nice for quickly pulling up things like my personal calendar, pulling up my Nest cameras if I hear something outside of the office, or checking personal email.

I also have little "flair" items like the Android and MailChimp mascots. I'm heavily in the Android ecosystem, and I once gave a talk at the MailChimp office in Atlanta so these are just nice personal items.

### Lower Desk


* Scanner
* Monitor
* MacBook
* Printer
* USB extender
* Mat on top of desk (to protect the desk)
* Shredder


I rarely use the lower desk since I stand for most of the day. However, it provides a secondary MacBook as well as an external monitor.


### Behind Desk

* USB-C extender
* Bench
* External Drives

## South Wall (Coffee/Snack Area)

* Coffee Machine
* K-Cup holder (sorry, single use pods are very useful)
* Game of Microphones (speaker badge trophies)
* Diplomas

The South Wall has what I consider to be my break area. I have a coffee machine to properly caffeinate myself throughout the day, healthy snacks, etc. I've thought about getting a water cooler, but that may be going too far.

## West Wall (Library and Kitchen)

* Book Shelves
* Mini-fridge
* Microwave
* Encouragement

1. Engagement Photo
2. Wedding Photo
3. Craft Hand drawn portrait

* Reminder of ways people have tried to find meaning

1. Thought
2. Christ
3. Glory

## North Wall (Nook)

* Curtain for privacy and sound proofing
* Curtain Rod
* Curtain Rod fasteners
* Coach
* Room Lamp
* Dustbuster
* Laptop Tray
