excerpt: "My public speaking career went fully international in 2017, and I am more thankful than ever for the privilege to take the stage at tech events. Once again, this is what I learned and my goals for the future."

As I did this time last year, here are my reflections on my public speaking experiences for 2017. 

speaker. So, inspired by [Cate](https://cate.blog/2016/12/15/2016-speaking-and-2017-goals/) and [Martin](http://martinb3.io/public-speaking-2016/), I'm reflecting on my experiences as a public speaker in 2016.

## Crossing International Boundaries

My first "talk" of 2016 was a [Lightning Talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) at [OSCON](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx-2016) in Austin. If you're not familiar with a Lightning Talk, it's a five minute talk where you present 20 slides that automatically advance. I've spoken at a lot of events for private companies as well as at many technology conferences, but I had no idea how hard it would be to do a Lightning Talk. I practiced a lot, but, during my talk, it seemed that time sped up turning five minutes into 30 seconds. Before I knew it, I was walking down the stairs thinking that I bombed. However, I received great feedback from the audience and saw some encouraging reactions on Twitter. That Lightning Talk became my [Lending Privilege](/talks/lending-privilege/) presentation which has become one of my signature talks.

OSCON also provided opportunities to meet other speakers. I shared a flight and an Uber with [Katrina Owen](http://www.kytrinyx.com/) who I met at OSCON because we both were booked to speak at the [Self.conference](http://selfconference.org/) in Detroit that same week. I was reminded that public speaking lets you build networks across companies instead of only being exposed to the experiences inside the walls of one company. This provides access to a peer group representing other companies, ideas, and cultures that are hard to explore only as an employee.

## Career Benefits

{% include image.html url="/images/speaking-retro-3.jpg" alt="workshop" caption="My workshop attendees" width=800 align="center" %}

I've given many private workshops during my career, but I gave my first workshop at a conference in June. It was my Hands-On Agile Project Management workshop that I gave at the [PMI Houston](http://pmihouston.org/content.php?page=Annual_Conference) conference. I really enjoyed presenting the content and guiding the participants through the exercises. I don't have a lot of workshops in my portfolio, but I plan to develop at least one in 2017.

## Spousal Support

I love big audiences, and I enjoyed big events in 2016 including Pivotal's [SpringOne Platform](https://springoneplatform.io/2016) in Las Vegas, [GitHub Universe](https://githubuniverse.com/2016/) in San Francisco, and [StrangeLoop](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2016/sessions.html) in St. Louis. These were all great experiences for me, and I was honored to lend my voice to those conferences. There's something powerful about being in a building with hundreds (and, in a few cases, thousands) of technologists who are all focused on advancing their careers and making the industry better. I was also reunited with other speakers who I met in previous years, and I enjoyed the opportunity to grow our friendships.
Small Intimacies


## Corporate Events

While big events are exhilarating, I was also invited to speak at smaller corporate events. I really enjoyed the intimacy of these events, and the Q&A sessions were usually longer and more personal. It seemed that people, as opposed to attending conferences hundreds of miles away among strangers, were more open to asking questions a few steps from their desks surrounded by their colleagues. I think my non-technical talks have more impact in these settings.


## Summary of 2017

So, 2016 provided:

* 8 conference presentations (OSCON, Self.conference, GitHub CodeConf, Pivotal's SpringOne Platform, DevOps Days Boston, GitHub Universe, StrangeLoop, PuppetConf)
* 4 corporate events
* 2 conferences as an attendee-only (Craft and Keep Austin Agile)
* 1 Workshop (PMI Houston)
* 1 Podcast (CodeNewbie)

## Goals for 2018

I can't give details, but one of the goals I wrote on New Year's Eve a few days ago was to give a talk on a new continent. I found out on New Year's Day that I would get that opportunity later this year!

I'm excited to have more international destinations in my speaking schedule, and I hope to bring my family along on at least one of these trips.

I also plan to do more talks about leadership and ethics in addition to the inclusion topics I covered in 2016. I also want to do more technical talks to balance the non-technical bent of most of my presentations.

I'm very happy with how my speaking career evolved in 2016, and I look forward to the opportunities that 2017 will bring!
