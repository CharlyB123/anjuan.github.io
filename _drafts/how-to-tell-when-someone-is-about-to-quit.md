- The key is a change in behavior
- update Linkedin profile
- update personal site
- update GitHub contributions to public repositories
- Conference room
- Exit Row - a hall leading to a parking garage where people would take phone calls
- start asking about vacation time (haven't taken a vacation in months)
- start taking a lot of vacation, but one or two days at a time (probably interviewing)
- Start showing up late to the office (when normally punctual)
- Start showing up late to meetings (when normally punctual)
- Starts taking long lunch breaks
- Used to regularly attend work events but suddenly stops coming
- Starts leaving digital groups (digitally separating from the company before physically leaving)
- They start taking their personal items from the office. That person who had a collection of children's toys set up around their desk suddenly has a clean workspace.
