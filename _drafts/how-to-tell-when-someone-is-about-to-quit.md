The resignation of an employee can have serious consequences for the company. That employee's role now has to be filled by someone else, and, even if the employee's replacement has the same role, the details are probably different.

- The key is a change in behavior
- update Linkedin profile
- update personal site
- update GitHub contributions to public repositories
- Conference room
- Exit Row - a hall leading to a parking garage where people would take phone calls
- start asking about vacation time (haven't taken a vacation in months)
- start taking a lot of vacation, but one or two days at a time (probably interviewing)
- Start showing up late to the office (when normally punctual)

- Starts taking long lunch breaks
- Used to regularly attend work events but suddenly stops coming
- Starts leaving digital groups (digitally separating from the company before physically leaving)
- They start taking their personal items from the office. That person who had a collection of children's toys set up around their desk suddenly has a clean workspace.
