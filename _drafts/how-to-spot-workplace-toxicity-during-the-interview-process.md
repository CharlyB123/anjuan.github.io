excerpt: "When you're looking for a job, making progress through the interview process can be exciting. However, don't let it blind you to clues that the company may have a toxic workplace."

* You get email updates from the hiring manager either very late at night or on the weekends
 * This is a sign that managers work late at night or on the weekends. It also shows that the hiring process is not a high priority. Why should you care? Well, your soon-to-be-new-colleagues probably came through a sloppy process.
* A current employee seems overworked and exhausted. And no one else seems to notice.
 * This is a sign that overwork and exhaustion are acceptable states for employees.
* You're supposed to interview with a member of the executive team during the office visit, but the interview is cancelled at the last minutes.
 * At least one member of the executivie team is probably overworked and doesn't seem to prioritize the hiring process.
 * If you talk to people at your level or below, they seem very interested in your current company.
  * They almost seem to want to ask if you're hiring.
* During the interview, one or more members of the interview panel work on their laptops or phones. This shows that the team is so overworked that they cannot be fully present when a candidate for employment is before them.
