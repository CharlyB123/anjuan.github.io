My career has spanned two decades, and I've navigated the move between companies several times during that period. So, I've had several chances to see the difference between how the company presents itself during the interview and how it actually operates on a daily basis. 

Remember, once you reach the end of the interview process and other candidates drop out, the company starts to sell itself to you as much as you're trying to sell yourself to it. This means that you'll see more of the Photoshopped version of the organization instead of how it looks without airbrushing.

Here are ways to peer behind the mask and spot potential blemishes in a potential employer's culture and operations.

## Updates Outside of Regular Hours

You'll get various emails throughout the interview process, and they usually come from the recruiter or the hiring manager. They usually contain updates about how you're doing in the process and provide opportunities for you to ask questions. Receiving these emails late at night (i.e., after 7pm in their local time zone) or on the weekend is a sign of a possible toxic workplace.
 
 This is a sign that the recruiting team and hiring managers may not treat the interview process as a high priority or that they have too much work to do during normal hours to fit in guiding you through the process. Why should you care? Well, your soon-to-be-new-colleagues may have also came through a sloppy process with deficiencies that a better implementation would have screened out. Also, working late at night and on the weekends could be an acceptable organizational process, and you may be pulling those same hours if you get and accept an offer from the company.

* A current employee seems overworked and exhausted. And no one else seems to notice.
 * This is a sign that overwork and exhaustion are acceptable states for employees.

* You're supposed to interview with a member of the executive team during the office visit, but the interview is cancelled at the last minute.
 * At least one member of the executive team is probably overworked and doesn't seem to prioritize the hiring process.

 * If you talk to people at your level or below, they seem very interested in your current company.
  * They almost seem to want to ask if you're hiring.
  
* During the interview, one or more members of the interview panel work on their laptops or phones. This shows that the team is so overworked that they cannot be fully present when a candidate for employment is before them.
