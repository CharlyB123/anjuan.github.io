I started journaling in early 2019 as a mindfulness practice.

## Previous Tools

### Notebooks

Loved the physicality of notebooks and writing in them with a pen. I've found that typing in a journal didn't have the psychological weight of writing. I have dozens of electronic journals in cloud storage, but they aren't as meaningful as my stack of paper journals.

However, I always feared losing my paper notebooks. I could use months if not years of thoughts. Also, I once lived in an apartment in Houston that was flooded during a hurricane. I have an innate fear of losing journals due to another natural disaster.

### Apps and Styli

Evernote, Google Notes, and OneNote all have stylus support so I tried them

Pros

Some could convert handwriting to text.

## My Requirements

My experiences with physical and electronic ways to journal weren't optimal, but they gave me a good idea of what I wanted:

* Provide the ability to physically write my journal entries
* Provide a backup of my journal entires in case of loss
* Some form of Search

## Notability and the Apple Pencil

TBD

## Finding What Works for You

I recommend Notability and the Apple Pencil, but the practice of journaling is the key.
