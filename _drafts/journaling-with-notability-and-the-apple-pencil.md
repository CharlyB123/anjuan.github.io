I started journaling in years ago as a mindfulness practice. My life usually goes at a fast pace from when I wake up in the morning to when I collapse into bed at the end of the day. After all, maintaining my relationship with my wife, tending to the needs of our three children, and performing my full time job as an Engineering Manager leave very few spare moments in my day.

However, I found that taking time to pause and write in my journal helped me pay attention to thoughts, memories, and observations that I was missing. Getting these things out of my head and into a journal freed up space in my mind and also provide a sense of calm.

I tried several methods tools over the years ranging from day planners to notebooks, but I found the perfect solution for me in the Notability app on the iPad and the Apple Pencil. However, it was a journey to get there.

## Previous Tools

### Notebooks

I loved the physicality of notebooks and writing in them with a pen. I've found that typing in a journal didn't have the psychological weight of writing. I have dozens of electronic journals in cloud storage, but they aren't as meaningful as my stack of paper journals.

I've tried many types of paper based notebooks over the years ranging from calendar based planners to dedicated journals. I eventually settled on my preferred setup:

* Spiral spine so that I could aways lay the journal flat while writing
* Pre-populated calendar dates on pages so that I wouldn't have to always write the date for my entries
* High grade paper
* A place to store my pen
* A wrap that would keep the journal closed
* A bookmark
* A nice ballpoint pen that didn't bleed through the pages

This is a link to the notebook that met all of these requirements, and I loved it!

However, the physicality of paper notebooks was also a weakness. I always feared losing my paper notebooks. I could use months if not years of thoughts. Also, I once lived in an apartment in Houston that was flooded during a hurricane. I have an innate fear of losing journals due to another natural disaster.

### Apps and Styli

Evernote, Google Keep, and OneNote all have stylus support so I tried them

Pros

Some could convert handwriting to text. 

Search

## My Requirements

My experiences with physical and electronic ways to journal weren't optimal, but they gave me a good idea of what I wanted:

* Provide the ability to physically write my journal entries
* Provide a backup of my journal entires in case of loss
* Some form of Search

## Notability and the Apple Pencil

### Benefits

Easy to write

Entries are automatically backed up to Google Drive

Insert video of copying text, moving text, drawing (both freehand and straight lines)

### My Approach to Journaling

You can find a lot of ways to journal online. Some people journal to create a list of things to be grateful, document affirmations, reflect on the past, plan for the future, etc. I don't have a particular format or method for journaling. It's more important for me to regularly journal as a personal practice than to constrain what I write.

I create a category in Notability for every month and have a page in each month with my journal entries. Notability will automatically put a date and time stamp on my journals, but I've started adding putting the date at the beginning of each entry so that this shows up in the backups stored in Google Drive.

## Future Upgrades

New ipad

New Apple Pencil - magnetically attaches to iPad

## Finding What Works for You

I recommend Notability and the Apple Pencil, but the practice of journaling is the key.
