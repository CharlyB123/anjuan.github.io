I started journaling in early 2019 as a mindfulness practice.

## Previous Tools

### Notebooks

Loved the physicality of notebooks and writing in them with a pen. I've found that typing in a journal didn't have the psychological weight of writing. I have dozens of electronic journals in cloud storage, but they aren't as meaningful as my stack of paper journals.

I've tried many types of paper based notebooks over the years ranging from calendar based planners to dedicated journals. I eventually settled on my preferred setup:

* Spiral spine so that I could aways lay the journal flat while writing
* Pre-populated calendar dates on pages so that I wouldn't have to always write the date for my entries
* High grade paper
* A place to store my pen
* A wrap that would keep the journal closed
* A bookmark
* A nice ballpoint pen that didn't bleed through the pages

This is a link to the notebook that met all of these requirements, and I loved it!

However, the physicality of paper notebooks was also a weakness. I always feared losing my paper notebooks. I could use months if not years of thoughts. Also, I once lived in an apartment in Houston that was flooded during a hurricane. I have an innate fear of losing journals due to another natural disaster.

### Apps and Styli

Evernote, Google Keep, and OneNote all have stylus support so I tried them

Pros

Some could convert handwriting to text.

## My Requirements

My experiences with physical and electronic ways to journal weren't optimal, but they gave me a good idea of what I wanted:

* Provide the ability to physically write my journal entries
* Provide a backup of my journal entires in case of loss
* Some form of Search

## Notability and the Apple Pencil

TBD

## Future Upgrades

New ipad

New Apple Pencil - magnetically attaches to iPad

## Finding What Works for You

I recommend Notability and the Apple Pencil, but the practice of journaling is the key.
