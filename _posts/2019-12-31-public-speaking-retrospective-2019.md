I published an end-of-the-year retrospective on my public speaking career in [2016](http://anjuansimmons.com/blog/public-speaking-retrospective-2016/), and I followed that with one for [2017](https://anjuansimmons.com/blog/public-speaking-retrospective-2017/). I didn't publish one in 2018 because the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 were incredibly busy for me. However, with a relatively recent sense of calm, here is my public speaking retrospective for 2019.

# What Went Well

I'm following the traditional format for a Sprint Retrospective by starting with the things that went well, and I would love to see continue in 2020.

## Speaking with my Wife

Managing the Burnout Burndown.


## Corporate Talks

Very few conferences pay speakers which has never been an issue for me since I have a full time career.



## Finding the Comfort Zone on Stage

There are a few things that could have been improved.

# Summary of 2018

Cities
* New York (Speaker)
* Baltimore (Speaker)

Countries


# Goals for 2019

## Return to Africa

I think I jinxed myself at the end of 2017. In the retrospective I wrote for that year, I mentioned that I had an opportunity to speak on a new continent.

## Continue Booking Corporate Talks

TBD

## Complete Book Manuscript

Severl people have asked my wife and I if we're planning to write a book based on our talk about burnout. I'm happy to announce that we are!
