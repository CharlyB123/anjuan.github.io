I've played Werewolf (and the varient called Mafia) for years, and it's a fun game. However, it can be difficult to get enough people together to play in the same physical location. This post describes how to play Werewolf using a remote meeting software application called Zoom.

# A Word of Caution

Werewolf is a game that requires deception and simulated killing. The deception is similar to other games like chess or Monopoly where you often have to hide your true intentions in order to win the game. The killing is similar to dodgeball where you're figuratively removed from the game (albeit in an often graphically gruesome way). Lying and the dramatization of murder can be unfortable to some players.

# Prerequisites

This post assumes that at least one person (ideally the person playing the Narrator) has a Zoom account. Zoom has two categories for the people in a meeting: host and participants. The host is the person who owns the account, and the participants are the people who join the host's accout.

Zoom has a Free Plan that provide all of the features that are needed to play Werewolf. However, for meetings with one host and two or more participants, the meeting will end after 40 minutes on the Free Plan. Since playing Werewolf requires seven or more people, you'll run into the time limit using Zoom's Free Plan. So, ideally, at least one person has access to a paid plan to use for Werewolf.

# Summary

Werewolf is a fun game that you don't have to wait until you get people in one physical location to enjoy. By using Zoom, you can play the game independent of location.
