I've played Werewolf (and the varient called Mafia) for years, and it's a fun game. However, it can be difficult to get enough people together to play in the same physical location. This post describes how to play Werewolf using a remote meeting software application called Zoom.

# A Word of Caution

Werewolf is a game that requires deception and simulated killing. The deception is similar to other games like chess or Monopoly where you often have to hide your true intentions in order to win the game. The killing is similar to dodgeball where you're figuratively removed from the game (albeit in an often graphically gruesome way). Lying and the dramatization of murder can be unfortable to some players.

# Prerequisites

This post assumes that at least one person (ideally the person playing the Narrator) has a Zoom account. Zoom has two categories for the people in a meeting: host and participants. The host is the person who owns the account, and the participants are the people who join the host's accout.

Zoom has a Free Plan that provide all of the features that are needed to play Werewolf. However, for meetings with one host and two or more participants, the meeting will end after 40 minutes on the Free Plan. Since playing Werewolf requires seven or more people, you'll run into the time limit using Zoom's Free Plan. So, ideally, at least one person has access to a paid plan to use for Werewolf.

This post also assumes that everyone has access to a computer with a webcam and a high speed internet connection. Whoever has the host account should send the meeting link out before the Werewolf session starts so that everyone can make sure it works for them before playing the game.

# Before the First Round

Werewolf is played in a round consisting of Day and Night. The Day part of the round is when the townspeople are active and try to determine who is a Werewolf so that they can be killed and removed from the game. The Night part of the round is when the Werewolves are active and try to kill the townspeople. The game is over when all of the Werewolves are killed or the number of Townspeople is equal to or less than the number of Werewolves left in the game.

Before the first round starts, the people playing Werewolf need to complete a few actions.

## Login to Zoom

The person who owns the Zoom account should send the meeting URL to everyone who wants to play Werewolf. This will put everone in the same virtual meeting rooom. 

## Cameras On

Everyone playing Werewolf should start with their cameras turned on. This is important for later in the game.

## Make the Narrator the Host

If the Narrator is not the host, then the person who owns the Zoom account should make the Narrator the host.

## Participants Raise Their Hand

Zoom has a feature called "Raise Hand" that is usually used to let the host know that a participant has a question. For Werewolf, this feature will be used to determine the people who are still in the game. At this point, everyone (except the Narrator) should select "Raise Hand" (the way to do this varies based on the client you're using to access Zoom).

## Narrator Assigns Roles

The Narrator should use the chat feature in Zoom to send a private message to everyone playing Werewolf that tells them their role. It's important that no player share or signify in any way the role assigned to them. There are four roles in the basic version of Werewolf:

### Townsperson

You're a regular member of the town. Perhaps you're a baker, merchant, or soldier. Your job is to save the town by eliminating the Werewolves that have infiltrated your town and started feeding on your neighbors. Also, try to avoid getting killed yourself.

### Werewolf

During the day you seem to be a regular Townsperson. However, you've been kissed by the Night and transform into a Werewolf when the sun sets. Your new nature compels you to kill and eat a Townsperson every night.

### Seer

You're a Townsperson 

# The First Round

# Summary

Werewolf is a fun game that you don't have to wait until you get people in one physical location to enjoy. By using Zoom, you can play the game independent of location.
