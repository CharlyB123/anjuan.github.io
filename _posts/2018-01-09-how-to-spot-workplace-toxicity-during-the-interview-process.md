My career has spanned two decades, and I've navigated the move between companies several times during that period. So, I've had several chances to see the difference between how the company presents itself during the interview and how it actually operates on a daily basis. 

Remember, once you reach the end of the interview process and other candidates are selected out, the company starts to sell itself to you as much as you're trying to sell yourself to it. This means that you'll see more of the Photoshopped version of the organization instead of how it looks without airbrushing.

Here are ways to peer behind the mask and spot potential blemishes in a potential employer's culture and operations during the interview process.

## Updates Outside of Regular Hours

You'll get various emails throughout the interview process, and they usually come from the recruiter or the hiring manager. They usually contain updates about how you're doing in the process and provide opportunities for you to ask questions. Receiving these emails late at night (i.e., after 7pm in their local time zone) or on the weekend is a sign of a possible toxic workplace.
 
This is a sign that the recruiting team and hiring managers may not treat the interview process as a high priority or that they have too much work to do during normal hours to fit in guiding you through the process. Why should you care? Well, your soon-to-be-new-colleagues may have also came through a sloppy process with deficiencies that a better implementation would have screened out. Also, working late at night and on the weekends could be an acceptable organizational process, and you may be pulling those same hours if you get and accept an offer from the company.

## Exhausted Employees

Most companies follow the traditional format of an initial phone screen (to make sure you match the impression suggested your resume), a phone screen with the hiring manager (to get a sense if you can do the job), and then an office visit (to see how you interact with your potential new colleagues). I've had a lot of office visits in my career, and I have, on more than one occasion, noticed an employee who seems totally exhausted (e.g., blood shot eyes, excessive yawning, and general lethargy).

What's particularly shocking in these cases is that most of the other employees don't seem to notice. This is a sign that overwork and exhaustion are acceptable states for employees even when the company is trying to present itself in the best light.

## Reverse Interview

It's been rare, but I've had the awkward experience of being interviewed during the office visit by someone who seems very interested in **my** current company. With longing in their voice, they asked about the development stack, culture, and perks of the company I was trying to leave in order to join their organization. In each case, the interviewer seemed on the edge of asking me if my current company was hiring!

If someone is so dissatisfied that they can't mask it during the interview process, then that's a major sign that something is toxic at the company. If someone is desperately trying to run away from a building, that's not somewhere I want to enter.

## Executive Team Cancellations

An office visit often includes a (usually short) interview with a member of the executive team. However, if this meeting is cancelled at the last minute, this gives you a lot of insight into the leadership of the company.

A last minute cancellation by a member of the executive team may indicate that the leaders of the company are too busy to prioritize and hiring process and meet their commitments to potential future employees. Company executives make time for the people who are important to them and their business. Failing to make a previously scheduled meeting with you during the interview process could be a sign that you won't be seen as a priority to the top of the company.

## Driven to Distraction

Office visits sometime include an interview with a panel of employees. This gives multiple people the opportunity to assess you at the same time. It's a major red flag if, during the panel interview, one or more members work on their laptops or mobile phones. While it's possible that these devices are being used to take note, you can normally tell if this is the case based on the level of eye contact.

This behavior could also be a sign that employees of the company are so overworked that they cannot be fully present when a candidate for employment is before them. This may an indicator that you won't be treated with respect if join the organization.

## Conclusion

While you can't understand the culture of a company until you spend several months interacting with it, these are the signs that you could be joining a toxic workplace. While it's common to focus on how you're presenting yourself during the interview process, it's critical that you also critically assess the organization that you may trust with your employment.
