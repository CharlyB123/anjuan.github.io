I visited Denver the week of September 16th, 2019 as a Denver Startup Week Ambassador. Denver Startup Week (DSW) is a five day series of events that showcases the vibrant startup scene in Denver. I felt that DSW had a vibe very similar to South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin. There was a ton of awesome programming as well as several evening activities. 

As a DSW Ambassador, I had the privilege of getting an intimate series of meetings with some of the most successful startup companies in Denver. We were given exclusive access to startup founders, their leadership teams, and exclusive events during Denver Startup Week. 

Out of hundreds of applicants, I was one of 50 people selected to travel to Denver as a DSW Ambassador. I was extremely honored to be a part of this group which was created to span across geographies, industries, and technical backgrounds. We were also a very diverse bunch representing various genders, races, and ethnicities.

# Monday - Southwest Airlines, Sheets and Giggles, Catalyst, Pie Insurance

My journey started early in the morning on Monday, September 16th. I normally fly out of George Bush International Airport (IAH), but, [Southwest Airlines](https://www.southwest.com/) sponosrs the DSW Ambassador program by providing a free flight for all 50 participants. Since Soutwest only flies out of Houston's Hobby Airport (HOU), I had to drive from my home in north Houston (passing IAH) to make it to Hobby in time for my flight. Fortunately, it was so early that I didn't run into any traffic and made it to the airport in almost the same about of time it takes me to get to IAH. I parked my car in the garage and boarded my flight with plenty of time to spare.

I believe that the best flight is an uneventful one, and I made it to Denver without incident. In an effort to keep the cost of travel low, the DSW Amabassor program also provided a free ticket to use for the train from the airport to downtown. So, I walked from the gate to the terminal and boarded the train.

I enjoyed watching the Denver landscape pass by as the train travelled down the track. It has been a couple of years since I was last in Denver, and I enjoyed watching folks get on and off the train. I'm a big fan of public transit because its better for the environment and also costs less than alternative forms of transportation. I soon reached my stop at Union Station.
