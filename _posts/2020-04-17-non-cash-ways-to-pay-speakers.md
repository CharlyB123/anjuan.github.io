# Paying Speakers

*Note: I drafted this way before the current coronovirus global pandemic. Given the devastation this has wrecked on the global conference market, I thought about shelving it for better days. However, I think that events now have a heavy incentive to become virtual experiences. That means that finding creative way to reward speakers will be more important than ever.* 


I've been fortunate to develop my public speaking to the level where I regularly receive some form of cash compensation for my presentations. Speakers engage in a large amount of labor including creating compelling talks, rehearsing, taking on the stress of travel, and then presenting on stage in a way that will keep the attention of attendees. Since speakers often drive ticket sales, it makes sense to share a portion of that revenue with the people who create content for the event.

However, event organizes often expect speakers to do all of this labor without payment. Despite having prominent sponsors and often charging hundreds of dollars per ticket, they may not have the budget to pay speakers. Also, the event may be in a country where paying speakers presents difficult tax of visa complications.

There are creative ways that conference organizers can compensate speakers without making direct cash payments. 


## Gifts

There are few things nicer than getting an unexpected gift. Providing speakers some token of your appreciation, especially if tied to the host city or them of the conference, can do a lot to cement your relationship with them.

### Themed Gifts

I once received a pair of cowboy boots for a conference held in Nashville. The conference had to plan in advance by asking me for my shoe size when I registered for my speaker ticket. I was very appreciative of this gesture, and I still remember that conference when I wear my boots even though that event was years ago.

### Gift cards

While not as personal as a themed gift, a gift card can be a nice gesture.

## Self-Care

Massage, manicure, pedicure

## Employment Assistance

Discretely ask if any speakers are looking for work and arrange a one-on-one meeting with the event vendors and sponsors that are hiring for the skill set of the speaker

## Altruism

Make a contribution in the name of the speaker to a charity of their choosing

## Vanity

Personalized gifts like bags or chargers. Hand drawn pictures. Will need to have headshots. Pick interesting background images (like the host city) or a fun theme like super hero (maybe ask their favorite super hero beforehand)

## Travel

While these ideas will require some room in your budget (and have to wait until the lockdowns imposed due to the coronavirus are lifted), they can go a long way towards rewarding your speakers without directly paying speaker fees.

### Lump Sum Reimbursement

If the speaker is arranging their own travel arrangements, event organizers can offer a lump sum reimbursement. That means that instead of directly paying the exact cost of the flight, hotel, etc.), the speaker can be offered a set amount that they will be reimbursed. This requires knowing a reasonable range of travel costs based on the speaker's point of origin. This benefits the speaker by letting them pocket the difference if they find great deals for their travel costs. Speakers can also get creative with how they arrange their travel. For example, some may choose to use reward miles for their flights and then get the cash value from the reimbursement.

### Fly first class or business class

For event organizers who are arranging flights for speakers, bumping their travel to first class or business class can greatly ease the stress of travel. This is especially valuable for long international flights.

### Upgraded hotel room

Similar to flights, booking upgraded hotel rooms can go a long ways towards making travel easier for speakers. This is even better when perks like a free breakfast can be included.

## Tours

Speakers often find it difficult to explore the cities they visit to speak at conferences due to the preparation time needed to perform well on stage as well as the need to attend to their regular job and also stay in contact with their families and friends. Making it easier to see more of the city can make their trip even more memorable. These ideas are also dependent on current travel restrictions being lifted.

### City Tours


### Venue Tours

(e.g., museums like the Rock and Roll museum or the city thing in St. Louis at Strange Loop)

# Summary

Coming up with creative non-cash ways to compensate speakers for the labor they perform for your event can go a long way towards helping them feel appreciated. Furthermore, events that find novel ways to reward speakers will attract more speaker interest in the future.
