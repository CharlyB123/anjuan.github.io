I've had the honor of serving in the South by Southwest (SXSW) Interactive Advisory Board (AB) for several years. While I can't discuss the details of any proposal, I can share with you what increases the odds of your proposal getting my vote.

Keep in mind, the the AB approaches votes by looking at what each *individual board member* would want to see at SXSW. So, this guide can only help you with what AB members like me like to see. Other AB members probably have different tastes and approaches to the evaluation process.

## The Selection Process

SXSW provides a big stage for presenting your ideas, and there is a lot of competition for a spot in the schedule. There were 4,400 proposals received for the 2017 event, and only a small percentage can be accepted. 

There are three parties in the selection process, and eash one has a percentage influence in what gets accepted:

* 30% - Public Votes (every idea can receive votes from the public
* 30% - Staff (seasoned experts who know what makes a great SXSW experience)
* 40% - Advisory Board (an international group of industry experts)

## The Panel Picker

Every year, SXSW announces that the [Panel Picker](panelpicker.sxsw.com) is open for proposals. The Panel Picker is an online tool that anyone can use to describe their idea for what should be a session at SXSW. It allows you to describe the session organizer (who may or may not be one of the speakers), the title of your idea and intended audience, a description of your session and the three questions it will answer, resources to support your idea (videos, slides, etc.), and the people will lead yours session.
