I started 2016 with a number of ambitious goals, and I met many of them. I grew as a technologist, maintained a healthy regimen of eating and exercise, left a company to start a new chapter in my career, and enjoyed many loving relationships with family and friends. However, I want to focus this post on the goal that far exceeded my expectations: grow as a public speaker. So, inspired by [Cate](https://cate.blog/2016/12/15/2016-speaking-and-2017-goals/) and [Martin](http://martinb3.io/public-speaking-2016/), I'm reflecting on my experiences as a public speaker in 2016.

## Learning from the Audience

I believe that great speakers are great audience members, and I was fortunate to attend two conferences ([Craft](https://craft-conf.com/2016/) in Budapest and [Keep Austin Agile](http://2016conf.agileaustin.org/)) as an attendee-only. As an audience member, I can learn from the presentation while also analyzing the style of the presenter. While I love being on stage, I will always "just be in the audience" for at least one conference a year. This helps me hone my craft while also learning to be a better speaker.

## A Lightning Start

{% include image.html url="/images/speaking-retro-2.jpg" alt="OSCON" caption="Giving my Lightning Talk at OSCON" width=600 align="center" %}

My first "talk" of 2016 was a [Lightning Talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) at [OSCON](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx-2016) in Austin. If you're not familiar with a Lightning Talk, it's a five minute talk where you present 20 slides that automatically advance. I've spoken at a lot of events for private companies as well as at many technology conferences, but I had no idea how hard it would be to do a Lightning Talk. I practiced a lot, but, during my talk, it seemed that time sped up turning five minutes into 30 seconds. Before I knew it, I was walking down the stairs thinking that I bombed. However, I received great feedback from the audience and saw some encouraging reactions on Twitter. That Lightning Talk became my [Lending Privilege](/talks/lending-privilege/) presentation which has become one of my signature talks.

OSCON also provided opportunities to meet other speakers. I shared a flight and an Uber with [Katrina Owen](http://www.kytrinyx.com/) who I met at OSCON because we both were booked to speak at the [Self.conference](http://selfconference.org/) in Detroit that same week. I was reminded that public speaking lets you build networks across companies instead of only being exposed to the experiences inside the walls of one company. This provides access to a peer group representing other companies, ideas, and cultures that are hard to explore only as an employee.

## My First Public Workshop

{% include image.html url="/images/speaking-retro-3.jpg" alt="workshop" caption="My workshop attendees" width=800 align="center" %}

I've given many private workshops during my career, but I gave my first workshop at a conference in June. It was my Hands-On Agile Project Management workshop that I gave at the [PMI Houston](http://pmihouston.org/content.php?page=Annual_Conference) conference. I really enjoyed presenting the content and guiding the participants through the exercises. I don't have a lot of workshops in my portfolio, but I plan to develop at least one in 2017.

## Big Audiences

{% include image.html url="/images/speaking-retro-4.jpg" alt="big audience" caption="The power of big audiences" width=800 align="center" %}

I love big audiences, and I enjoyed big events in 2016 including Pivotal's [SpringOne Platform](https://springoneplatform.io/2016) in Las Vegas, [GitHub Universe](https://githubuniverse.com/2016/) in San Francisco, and [StrangeLoop](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2016/sessions.html) in St. Louis. These were all great experiences for me, and I was honored to lend my voice to those conferences. There's something powerful about being in a building with hundreds (and, in a few cases, thousands) of technologists who are all focused on advancing their careers and making the industry better. I was also reunited with other speakers who I met in previous years, and I enjoyed the opportunity to grow our friendships.

## Speaking at a corporate event

While big events are exhilarating, I was also invited to speak at smaller corporate events. I really enjoyed the intimacy of these events, and the Q&A sessions were usually longer and more personal. It seemed that people, as opposed to attending conferences hundreds of miles away among strangers, were more open to asking questions a few steps from their desks surrounded by their colleagues. I think my non-technical talks have more impact in these settings.


## The CodeNewbie Podcast

I was a guest on the fabulous [CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/) podcast hosted by [Saron Yitbarek](https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek). Saron is a skilled interviewer, and I really enjoyed speaking with her. I dip into the CodeNewbie Twitter chat when I can, and I really enjoy the CodeNewbie community.

## Summary of 2016

So, 2016 provided:

* 8 conference presentations (OSCON, Self.conference, GitHub CodeConf, Pivotal's SpringOne Platform, DevOps Days Boston, GitHub Universe, StrangeLoop, PuppetConf)
* 4 corporate events
* 2 conferences as an attendee-only (Craft and Keep Austin Agile)
* 1 Workshop (PMI Houston)
* 1 Podcast (CodeNewbie)

## Goals for 2017

I have a number of big conference presentations scheduled for 2017, but I'm starting to do more corporate events. While I do well as a speaker, I have a full time job and a family so my ability to appear at events that are fixed on the calendar is limited. However, corporate events are far more flexible, and I can usually pick the dates that work for my schedule.

I'm excited to have more international destinations in my speaking schedule, and I hope to bring my family along on at least one of these trips.

I also plan to do more talks about leadership and ethics in addition to the inclusion topics I covered in 2016. I also want to do more technical talks to balance the non-technical bent of most of my presentations.

I'm very happy with how my speaking career evolved in 2016, and I look forward to the opportunities that 2017 will bring!
