I've read about health for my entire adult life, and, when I entered my 40s, I really began to think deeply about what I can do to develop and maintain a high level of physical fitness. I've boiled down what I'e learned into an acronym called SNES. This stands for

* **S**leep
* **N**utrition
* **E**xcercise
* **S**tress

# Sleep

This is first because nothing else you do can really compensate for a lack of sleep. It's vital to optimize the amount and quality of your sleep.

# Nutrition

My main tools for how I approach nutrition are intermittent fasting and keto. I was bulletproof up until age 40, but the past few years have brought kidney stones and a blood clot in my left leg. Intermittent fasting and keto have done wonders for both, and I also follow a low oxalate diet.

# Excercise

Sleep and nutrition are about improving the things you have to do every day. Exercise is an optional activity, but it's an extremely important investment in your health. I don't like exercise, but I love how it makes me feel. I recommitted to exercise several months ago, and I started just walking around the block, and I have built up to working out 2-3 times a week in a gym and hiking a couple of times a week. And, I don't spend much more than an hour per workout. A little goes a long way.

# Stress

This is at the end because it's important to end stress in our lives. Of course, totally ending it is impossible, but it's always worth learning better ways to manage stress. One key tool in this area is embracing the fact that I'm an introvert, and a lot of my self-care is giving myself time to rest and research in silence and solitude. That's how I recharge and recover from stressful situations.

# Summary

While staying healthy and fit can be complicated, the SNES method is a lightweight framework for thinking about the components of a healthy lifestyle. Each component can be modified according to the goals you're trying to achieve. I primarily want to be energetic and active for the next few decades of my life, and I'm finding the SNES method to be very effective for achieving those outcomes.
