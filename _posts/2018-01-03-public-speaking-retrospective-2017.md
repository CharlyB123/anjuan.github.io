As I did this [time last year](http://anjuansimmons.com/blog/public-speaking-retrospective-2016/), here are my reflections on my public speaking experiences in 2017. Last year provided amazing opportunities to level up my skills as a speaker as well as a human being.

## Signature Talks

I'm a firm believer in the practice known as "recycling talks". This means giving the same talk at multiple events instead of trying to create a brand new talk for each event. I think that new speakers often try to do the latter because they think that tech events don't want talks that have been previously given. While there are a few exceptions, the opposite is almost always true.

There are few things more compelling to event organizers than a battle-tested talk that has been delivered at multiple events and survivied multiple first-contact impacts with attendees. This is especially true if you can show positive feedback from these attendees on Twitter. Event organizers want speakers who can pack rooms, and a talk that has been given in front of large audiences is more likely to draw a large audience.

Think of your favorite song. Do you ever get tired of hearing that song? It's the same way with a strong talk. Even people who have heard it before don't mind hearing it again, and they often look forward to seeing the reactions of people who are experiencing it for the first time. They know where the points will be driven home and when the funny parts are about to be given.

## Crossing International Boundaries

My first talk of 2017 was in New York City, but, as the year progressed, I took the stage in the UK, Hungary, and Canada. While I always speak before technical audiences, I really enjoyed finding ways to fit the locale into my talk. This expands my thinking about the topic of my talk, and attendees from the local area appreciate the recognition.

I'm not a fulltime speaker so I'm almost always working when I travel to give a talk. It wasn't unusual for me to fly in the night before my scheduled session, manage meetings from my hotel room right before I need to go on stage, give my talk, chat with a few attendees, and then rush back to my room for more meetings. I then flew back to Houston as soon as possible and tried to get as much done on the plane as I could before the wifi died.

While I'm incredibly grateful to have the opportunitiy to speak at international conferences, there is a cost. I hope to actually enjoy the cities where I'm invited to speak more in 2018.

## Goals for 2018

I can't give details, but one of the goals I wrote on New Year's Eve a few days ago was to give a talk on a new continent. I found out on New Year's Day that I would get that opportunity later this year!

Actually enjoy the countries I visit/Arrive a few days before my slot/tour around

I'm excited to have more international destinations in my speaking schedule, and I hope to bring my family along on at least one of these trips.

I also plan to do more talks about leadership and ethics in addition to the inclusion topics I covered in 2016. I also want to do more technical talks to balance the non-technical bent of most of my presentations.

I'm very happy with how my speaking career evolved in 2016, and I look forward to the opportunities that 2017 will bring!
