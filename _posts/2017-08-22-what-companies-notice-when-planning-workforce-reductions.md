excerpt: "A reduction in force (RIF) is an act to remove headcount in order to satisfy budgetary concerns. Knowing what companies notice when planning a RIF can help you avoid being included in one."

One concept that was drilled into my head when I was earning my MBA from the [Mays Business School](http://mays.tamu.edu/) was that corporations exist to maximize shareholder value. I have observed the truth of this concept throughout my professional career, and it is most powerfully expressed in how corporations treat their employees; especially when they decide to get rid of them.

Paying employees is one of the largest expenses in the budget of any corporation. Therefore, when other aspects of the business are underperforming (sales, revenue, investments, etc.), cutting the payroll can be a quick way to improve the financial health of a business. A reduction in force (RIF) is one way to do that.

A RIF is something that most people experience from the wrong side, but, if you think like someone who would have to plan a RIF, you can reduce your chance of being terminated. I have been involved in planning RIFs across multiple companies, and here are the things that are noticed during these meetings.


## Behavior


* If you come to work late, take long breaks, and leave early, it will be noticed.
* If you're looking at your phone at your desk more than you use your work computer, it will be noticed. 

## Performance

* If your deliverables are regularly late, but your Twitter is lit (especially during work hours), it will be noticed. 

## Revenue

* If it is hard to see the link between what you do for the organization and the revenue generated by the organization, it will be noticed.

## Culture

* If you don't contribute to a positive workplace environment, it will be noticed. 
* If you're reading this on a work computer during working hours, it will be noticed.


## Conclusion

I'm glad to still have a job, and I wanted to share what organizations discuss when they have to decide who to no longer employ. In these turbulent times, protect your paper. (
