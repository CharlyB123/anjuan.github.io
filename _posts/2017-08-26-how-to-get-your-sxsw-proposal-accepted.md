I've had the honor of serving in the SXSW Advisory Board for several years. While I can't discuss the details of any proposal, I can share with you what increases the odds of your proposal getting my vote.

Keep in mind, the the AB approaches votes by looking at what each *individual board member* would want to see at SXSW. So, this guide can only help you with what AB members like me like to see.
