This is the first post in an irregularly scheduled series of the work I'm doing building out this site. This site is my personal repository of my content on the internet, but it's also an expression of what I've learned using Jeklyll to create a website. That includes learning more about GitHub, Markdown, HTML, CSS, and other tech topics.

Here is what I've done to bring the site it's current version.

## Choosing a Template

I had an idea of what I wanted based on the layout I personally like when viewing websites. Generally, I like a top navigation scheme with a lightweight design. I did a google search for `jekyll themes` and found the descriptively named [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) site.

I browsed several pages of this site until I settled on two options: [Moon](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/moon/) by Taylan Tati and [Steve's NGVB (No-Good-Very-Bad) Theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/svm-ngvb/) by Steven V. Miller. The Jekyll Themes site lets you look at the source of the templates in GitHub as well as demo a working version. The Moon theme had a very snazzy design, but I liked the straight-forward design of Steven's theme. Steven's theme was also structured simiarly to the version of my site hosted on Google Sites.
