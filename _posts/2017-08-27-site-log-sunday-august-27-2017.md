This is the first post in an irregularly scheduled series of the work I'm doing building out this site. This site is my personal repository of my content on the internet, but it's also an expression of what I've learned using Jeklyll to create a website. That includes learning more about GitHub, Markdown, HTML, CSS, and other tech topics.

Here is what I've done to bring the site it's current version.

## Choosing a Template

I had an idea of what I wanted based on the layout I personally like when viewing websites. Generally, I like a top navigation scheme with a lightweight design. I did a google search for `jekyll themes` and found the descriptively named [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) site.



## The Results

TBD

## Conclusion
