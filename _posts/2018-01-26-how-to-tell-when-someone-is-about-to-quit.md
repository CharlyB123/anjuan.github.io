The resignation of an employee can have serious consequences for the company. That employee's role now has to be filled by someone else, and, even if the employee's replacement has the same role, the details are probably different. However, most people telegraph their upcoming departure through changes in behavior, and picking up on these changes can help you avoid being surprised.

## Online Changes

Most of the people you work with have online profiles, and it's not unusual, after working with someone for an extended period of time, to get access to their professional and personal social networks. Changes to these networks can provide insights into how your colleagues feel about work.

If you suddenly see changes to their LinkedIn profiles, this could be a hint that they are updating their professional profile to be more attractive to potential recruiters and potential future employers. This is especially true if there's been a long period of time since you saw changes to their LinkedIn information. If you're not connected to them on LinkedIn, a sudden invitation to join their LinkedIn network may suggest that they want a way to stay in touch with you after they are removed from internal communication tools. 

If you work with developers who use GitHub, then a sudden flurry of contributions to public repositories may be an indicator that they are thinking of changing companies. GitHub can be a useful tool to show the kind of code a developer can produce as well as the open source projects to which they contribute. Suddenly becoming active of GitHub may suggest that they are buffing their portfolio of code.

If your colleague has a personal website, then sudden updates (e.g., new pages, a different theme, a flurry of blog posts) may be another indicator that they are trying to make their online presence as positive as possible.

## Location Changes

Working at a company for a long period of time usually causes predictable movements among employees. There's the morning crowding in the break room while people groggily grab coffee. Then there's the assembly before noon as people find somewhere to eat lunch.

People who are about to quit change their movements. Instead of joining the lunch bunch as usual, they camp out in a conference room and speak into their cell phones using hushed tones. Or, while coming into work, you see them talking on their phone behind the parking garage. These location changes usually mean that they are covertly engaged in phone interviews.

## Schedule Changes

Time is the most precious non-renewable resource, and how people spin their time tells you a lot about them. If a co-worker, who normally goes months without vacation, suddenly starts asking about the vacation policy then that's a sign they may be about to quit. They are either about to use vacation time to take part in interviews, or they want to know how much they will be paid out in unused vacation.

Changes in punctuality is another sign. Colleagues who are normally punctual in their arrival time to the office and showing up to meetings often start running late when they're looking for other opportunities. It can be tough managing interviews and maintaining the schedule of a company you're trying to leave.

Furthermore, if co-workers who normally attend the regular happy hour after work or other gatherings, then they may be socially closing off in anticipation of their future severance from your organization.

## Workspace Changes

We often make our workspaces a representation of our personalities and interests. When colleagues start taking their personal items from the office, then they are starting their physical separation. Examples of this are people person normally have a collection of family pictures and swag from conferences on their desk suddenly have a clean workspace. They start taking their personal items away from the office because they may fear that their job search may be detected and result in their termination. They don't want worry if they have everything in the event they are escorted from the office.

## Responsibility Changes

Co-workers who have spent months asking for more responsibility and suddenly go quiet may be signaling that they are looking for that responsibility elsewhere. This sudden loss of desire and urgency may suggest that they have lost interest in continuing to work for your organization.

Another sign that employees are thinking about moving on is when they begin setting up others to do their role. They may insist that it's cross-training to add redundancy in case they are ever hit by a bus, but they may have actually hit the lottery of an offer from another employer. 


## What Do You Do?

If you notice these changes, the first thing you should do is not panic. Looking for a new employer is normally stressful, and you don't need to add your own panic to the psychic weight of your colleague.

If you have a strong relationship with the person exhibiting these signs, then you may want to have a candid conversation with them. It's best to do this away from the workplace. Structure this conversation as a way to understand their concerns instead of convincing them to stay.

If you don't have a strong relationship with this person, then that's a more difficult situation. You may want to share your observations with their direct manager and get feedback. 

In any case, you probably should think about a mitigation plans if your read of the situation turns out to be correct. Sometimes the best thing you can do for your company is letting an employee leave and focusing on preparing the organization for their exit.
