This page serves as a directory of the talks I give at tech events. Each link will take you to an individual page for each talk including the abstract, description, slides, videos, and testimonials from attendees. If you would like to collaborate with me on a talk, send an email to me, and I would be happy to discuss the idea.

I have always cherished the power of speech. History is filled with movements that were propelled by people who were able to capture their essence and express them in words. Speaking is a privilege, and I always strive to be worthy of the stage and the audience that gathers to hear what I have to say.
