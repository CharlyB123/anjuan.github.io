Hi, welcome to my personal site on the web. Most of the content on this site is about my career in techology, but, if you really want to know what I care about, look no further than my family. No matter whatever goals I achieve or successes I create, nothing will be more meaningful or significant to me than my family.

You can view the source for my website on GitHub. Feel free to fork and use it to build your own site.
